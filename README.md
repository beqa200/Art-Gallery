# Art-Gallery
Junior Project

It's my second fully responsive website.
Unlike the previous one I mainly used Viewport Widths(vw) as relative dimensions.
I know it's not quite good way but I wanted to understand how they works.
They are necessary and useful at specific situations but not always.

I also used grids. Before I mainly using flexboxes, but grid also is a good positioning tool.
